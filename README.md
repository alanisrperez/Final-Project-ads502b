# Final-Project-ads502b

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive medical condition characterised by kidney damage that may lead to more severe complications if not treated early. The purpose of this project is to classify patients as high- or low/moderate-risk of CKD using a synthetic dataset obtained from Kaggle created for machine learning research and practice. This clean dataset did not contain missing values or inconsistency, allowing for smooth data analysis and modeling. The two primary classification models applied are logistic regression, to estimate the probability of CKD, and random forest, to identify key predictors. These models were evaluated by looking at evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Analyses of feature importance and coefficients were run to interpret results. An initial accuracy of 100% for random forest provoked a sanity check. Correlation analysis revealed strong correlations with GFR which was removed to make for a more realistic and challenging model. The results demonstrate the robustness of these models in identifying high-risk for CKD to pave the way for preventative healthcare interventions.
